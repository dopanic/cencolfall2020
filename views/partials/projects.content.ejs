        <h1>Bug Catcher</h1>
        <h2>HTML+JS+CSS, Aug 2020</h2>
        <p>As the part of the final assement of 2nd semester, I developed the bug catcher game using JavaScript.<br><br>The game is simple. When you click the bug image on the screen, you get a point. And the bug is disappeard and pop up somewhere else. The more you catch the bug, the faster the bug moves.</p>
